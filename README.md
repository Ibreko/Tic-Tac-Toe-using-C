# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C. The game allows two players to play against each other on a square grid of any size. Players take turns marking spaces on the grid until one player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw.

Features:
Play against another player on a customizable board size.
Keep track of player statistics, including wins, losses, and draws.
Option to continue playing or exit after each game.
Console-based user interface for easy gameplay.
Usage:
To play the game, compile the source code using a C compiler and run the executable. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the board size and make moves during the game. After each game, the program displays the final player statistics and prompts the users to continue playing or exit.

Note: This project was created for learning purposes as part of a programming exercise. A similar implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python can be found in this https://github.com/Ibreko/Tic-Tac-Toe.
